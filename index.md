## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, Part-1:

    This lab was a favorite because even though it had many equations and restrictions all the information was given. Its real world applications were also very interesting as itâ€™s much easier to envision and made writing more comprehendible.

* Lab 3, Part-2:

    Since this was a lab we did very early on it was really good at showing us how to make variables and how to convert strings to integers. Also, because there were equations provided it made it easier to check if our code was correct by inputting the information manually.

* Lab 11, Part-1:

    This was the first introduction we had to classes and although this was the most difficult one to complete it also was the best one to get us accosted to using the class function. I liked that it was a lab we could also use in the next lab as it had information and could that could be changed for the last one.
